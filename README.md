2024-03-25, i spent about an hour trying to fetch the depo, which i only have like half an hour until my call now. Daruma time! I am so sore and tired. A thunderstorm started while we were running at the asia games park. 

teeeeeeeeeeeeeesting 2024-03-20, 03-22 i cleaned all day

I've been busy designing these past few days. 2023-01-03

Should I upload my yt and bb videos to github too? Probably not, but maybe that vemoe site?

I am currently working on 30 days of drawing daily. I might keep going with it to 100 days like ïdid with the drinking streak. Non-drinking, but I should probab ly calculate whether I have passed 100 days yet. For not drinking any alcohol, I am at 201. Crazy.

I started in October, it's now the 19th of December, but I am still drawing daily. I plan to finish this sketchbook by Lunar New Years or Valentines day. Maybe by a month after opening it.

2024-07-06 Health tests results hyperfocus day. Taking a rest and i'll work in a bit. Just committing to beat midnight. I did review earlier, so it's okay.

2024-07-07 Still feeling out of it today, but tonight I am trying to figure out what is going on with the font awesome urls. This is a safety commit because my brain is really struggling to think today.

2024-07-08 PSB again today. D baught the train tickets for the 9th, so hopefully they just cooperate already.

2024-07-09 Panic packing on like 3 hours of sleep. This is a safety commit. I will work, but the internet will likely suck.

2024 Summer tour ( working notes for project)

2024-07-10 Yesterday was such a fun day! After arriving in Shanghai, we walked around the Huangpu district and to the bund. We walked around the lovely park and enjoyed the less-awful than Hangzhou's 35 degree weather as the humidity was half of what we have been living in. We found cooling shirt spray, which I definiely temperarily enjoy. We ended up at a restaurant David saw online called the Barbarian (pinapple skewer, mushrooms skewer, tri-coloured potatoes, and seabass with a cheesy Korean chili sauce) at the K11 mall. We saw the Oriental Pearl from a distance during the day and went to see the lights along the waterfront at night. It was beautiful. We took pictures with three sets of students, then walking we found a tuesday night Jazz show at a club called Blues & Jazz. IT was alright and expensive. 50 kuai each at the door plus three drinks (110kuai each rounded up), and David asked for water but they brought a big litre bottle of Sanpallegrino (maybe 60kuai). I guess they don't just give out water like bars and restaurants? It's fine, we're dehydrated anyways.

2024-07-11 flight scheduled to Munich. We went to the Shnaghai Museum, and had fantastic schwarma at Eli Shawarma. Made it to the airport early, got through without any issues, then had a yummy kimchi grilled cheese with dry ass chicken at O'Mill's . I ate the chicken seperate. The flight was delayed while we were at the gate but onboard, so we have been sitting here an hour so far just chillin. Many peopl ekeep bitching about their connection flights and such. I have cramps and need a changing coon. I  am alright. It was said to be 60 to 90 minutes, so our layover should be not long enough to see Munich. I am sad, but tired  anyways. This commit was written sitting before the plane takes taxi. KK, love you, byeeeeeeeeeeee

2024-07-12 We flew to Montreal with aslight delay from the air system not working. Noon the next day at my parents, we talked about trains with my dad for like two hours. Now David and Gary are compairing YouTube feeds.

2024-07-13 Went to Happy Lamb Hot Pot with Gary, David, and Ryan from school. it was yummy and good conversation. now we are currently driving on hwy 417 driving to Brazeau's new place for his party tonight. Not sure if people know we are coming.

2024-07-14 Celine and Alex brought a coffee for me, but i missed them as i was asleep. i thanked on text. Marc picked me up to meed david and hangout at guillaume brazeau's. a few hours later Marc drove us to Lise's place off place d'orleans . we are having a beer and figuring out a taxes issue for them. Also, the news is all over Donald Trump being shot recently.

2024-07-15 Relatively relaxed day. Some  intimacy, but mostly errands. Our planned dinner with the three of us and Zack ended up being David and I cooking for the four of us with Claire, Fern, and beau-grand-pere. Corn, and roasted porc belly and chicken. Asperagus, carrots, and a third. All is good. The news says it has been a heat wave. We have been cold. I love visiting for summer! 

2024-07-23 Done camping and being without internet, I believe. Picked up a textbook called Bug Bounty Bootcamp from Chapters today while walking around with Céline.

2024-07-24 Reading BBB today. Logged on to include this studying in my commits. Also, everyone used those QRs for their Wifi now. If you need it for pc, scan using the camera app and type the content following P: (exclusive) into the password field.

2024-07-27 yesterday i barely read BBB. Today is the big Dutrisac party, then tonight we are at Guillaume's again. I will work tomorrow, as it is a movie marathon. I am getting ready and packed quickly now, as I wish to read some more this morning.

2024-07-30 yesterday Veronica picked me up Lise's then we got subway in Embrun before arriving at the parents'. Today i slept in until noon, made an drippy english muffin, and picked up Chinese in Embrun for dinner alone with Dad. well, also played with Axel, whi bumped my nose and lip. The lip has shrunk back down, but my nose gave me a headache. Which i was helping my sister with homework, i asked dad if he had an example of a fallacy. He said the horn of a unicorn because its horn is phallic.

  <summary><b>:notebook: 2022 goal</b></summary>
  I planed to transfer my site <a href="https://techkeen.wixsite.com/website">TechKeen</a> from WIX to My GitHub <a href="https://teiresa.github.io/"> Page </a>. I plan to keep https://teiresa.github.io/ as the highest in the hiarchy, so <i>TechKeen </i> would really just be like a project, but like a project I treat as it's own thing. Currently, the high site is being tricky. I'm working on giving it a complete facelift while I have the time.
  </br></br> In the future, I will hopefully buy a domain. Until then, it gets to live here. 
  
  <br><br> I'm available for an entry-level or junior front-end dev position. Currently, I can only remote work.

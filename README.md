2025-06-10 studies for like 7 hours. Mostly react, and some review. Slept like 3 hours? I think 6 with waking up and other housely noises. 15:00 to 23:00.
2025-06-09 studied 

2025-06-08 day two back studying. I feel good about myself. I need to keep the habit. (Attempting React but i think i might need to revisit Javascript first)

2025-06-07 i signed up for LeetCode today. Someone mentioned it in chat, and i saw it mentioned a few times online. So far I am feeling like it should be helpful. Couldn't submit becuase i am too lazy to look for Doraemon phone. I'll come back when i find it. FreeCodeCamp has a new FE FS Dev program, so I am doing it.  (Bootstrap, JQuery, and SASS done)

And I have been making great strides with digital art. I'm starting to not hate everything I make. fgdddddddddd

2024-03-25, i spent about an hour trying to fetch the depo, which i only have like half an hour until my call now. Daruma time! I am so sore and tired. A thunderstorm started while we were running at the asia games park. hjashdfjahfsjhajsfhasdfasdf

teeeeeeeeeeeeeesting 2024-03-20, 03-22 i cleaned all day

I've been busy designing these past few days. 2023-01-03

Should I upload my yt and bb videos to github too? Probably not, but maybe that vemoe site?

I am currently working on 30 days of drawing daily. I might keep going with it to 100 days like ïdid with the drinking streak. Non-drinking, but I should probab ly calculate whether I have passed 100 days yet. For not drinking any alcohol, I am at 201. Crazy.

I started in October, it's now the 19th of December, but I am still drawing daily. I plan to finish this sketchbook by Lunar New Years or Valentines day. Maybe by a month after opening it.

2024-07-06 Health tests results hyperfocus day. Taking a rest and i'll work in a bit. Just committing to beat midnight. I did review earlier, so it's okay.

2024-07-07 Still feeling out of it today, but tonight I am trying to figure out what is going on with the font awesome urls. This is a safety commit because my brain is really struggling to think today.

2024-07-08 PSB again today. D baught the train tickets for the 9th, so hopefully they just cooperate already.

2024-07-09 Panic packing on like 3 hours of sleep. This is a safety commit. I will work, but the internet will likely suck.

2024 Summer tour ( working notes for project)

2024-07-10 Yesterday was such a fun day! After arriving in Shanghai, we walked around the Huangpu district and to the bund. We walked around the lovely park and enjoyed the less-awful than Hangzhou's 35 degree weather as the humidity was half of what we have been living in. We found cooling shirt spray, which I definiely temperarily enjoy. We ended up at a restaurant David saw online called the Barbarian (pinapple skewer, mushrooms skewer, tri-coloured potatoes, and seabass with a cheesy Korean chili sauce) at the K11 mall. We saw the Oriental Pearl from a distance during the day and went to see the lights along the waterfront at night. It was beautiful. We took pictures with three sets of students, then walking we found a tuesday night Jazz show at a club called Blues & Jazz. IT was alright and expensive. 50 kuai each at the door plus three drinks (110kuai each rounded up), and David asked for water but they brought a big litre bottle of Sanpallegrino (maybe 60kuai). I guess they don't just give out water like bars and restaurants? It's fine, we're dehydrated anyways.

2024-07-11 flight scheduled to Munich. We went to the Shnaghai Museum, and had fantastic schwarma at Eli Shawarma. Made it to the airport early, got through without any issues, then had a yummy kimchi grilled cheese with dry ass chicken at O'Mill's . I ate the chicken seperate. The flight was delayed while we were at the gate but onboard, so we have been sitting here an hour so far just chillin. Many peopl ekeep bitching about their connection flights and such. I have cramps and need a changing coon. I  am alright. It was said to be 60 to 90 minutes, so our layover should be not long enough to see Munich. I am sad, but tired  anyways. This commit was written sitting before the plane takes taxi. KK, love you, byeeeeeeeeeeee

2024-07-12 We flew to Montreal with aslight delay from the air system not working. Noon the next day at my parents, we talked about trains with my dad for like two hours. Now David and Gary are compairing YouTube feeds.

2024-07-13 Went to Happy Lamb Hot Pot with Gary, David, and Ryan from school. it was yummy and good conversation. now we are currently driving on hwy 417 driving to Brazeau's new place for his party tonight. Not sure if people know we are coming.

2024-07-14 Celine and Alex brought a coffee for me, but i missed them as i was asleep. i thanked on text. Marc picked me up to meed david and hangout at guillaume brazeau's. a few hours later Marc drove us to Lise's place off place d'orleans . we are having a beer and figuring out a taxes issue for them. Also, the news is all over Donald Trump being shot recently.

2024-07-15 Relatively relaxed day. Some  intimacy, but mostly errands. Our planned dinner with the three of us and Zack ended up being David and I cooking for the four of us with Claire, Fern, and beau-grand-pere. Corn, and roasted porc belly and chicken. Asperagus, carrots, and a third. All is good. The news says it has been a heat wave. We have been cold. I love visiting for summer! 

2024-07-23 Done camping and being without internet, I believe. Picked up a textbook called Bug Bounty Bootcamp from Chapters today while walking around with Céline.

2024-07-24 Reading BBB today. Logged on to include this studying in my commits. Also, everyone used those QRs for their Wifi now. If you need it for pc, scan using the camera app and type the content following P: (exclusive) into the password field.

2024-07-27 yesterday i barely read BBB. Today is the big Dutrisac party, then tonight we are at Guillaume's again. I will work tomorrow, as it is a movie marathon. I am getting ready and packed quickly now, as I wish to read some more this morning.

2024-07-30 yesterday Veronica picked me up Lise's then we got subway in Embrun before arriving at the parents'. Today i slept in until noon, made an drippy english muffin, and picked up Chinese in Embrun for dinner alone with Dad. well, also played with Axel, whi bumped my nose and lip. The lip has shrunk back down, but my nose gave me a headache. Which i was helping my sister with homework, i asked dad if he had an example of a fallacy. He said the horn of a unicorn because its horn is phallic.

2024-07-31 well, i am sick of seeing my siblings. Cheryl dropped by, Gary officially left, and now it is just Veronica, the folks, and me. Veronica had started being mean, so i am done hanging out with her. That was yesterday, but it continues into today. Apparently everything I do is wrong, so fuck it, I will chill alone until I can return to David in Orleans. But i am also annoyed with him for over-scheduling us, so now i will be burnt out before we start flying again. Greeeeat.

2024-08-01 i haven't done much today. Just hangngout and downloading episodes of Shoresy and Letterkenny. I am watching too many shows right now, but i started another today Fired On Mars. This afternoon I will have my parents drop me at either Lise's or Celine's. We have a group dinner at Perkins at 19:00. Eggs Benny!

2024-08-08 (because it's after midnight) We have been home since the night of th 7th, so i am finally updating now. We have been rather exhausted, so we mostly just did house work between naps. Yesterday morning (the 7th) we took a 05:30, 5km walk and grabbed jianbing and baozi. 

2024-08-09 Yesterday I meant to study or work or paint, however I ended up having a nap (well just sleeping the night) between 6pm and 23:00. Sucks, as i meant this to only be a two hour nap at maximum. 23:00-ish to around 03:00 I cleaned and tried to return our home to normal. We will be heading out for a walk ina bout an hour.

2024-08-11 worked on wall printer and crochet started cat ear rectangle hat

2024-08-13 i think i just crocheted and tried not to puke all day yesterday. Today I am working on the wall printed and crocheting the Chubby Chick 🐥 

2024-08-15 working on videos. three new ones recorded and ready (well, transferring via bluetooth) for editing. Editing one of the three now.

2024-08-20 I crocheted the chicken today, and finally replaced the burnt out light socket in the kitchen. Tomorrow I will force myself to study all day. Tonight I will review my code and figure out a plan for tomorrow.

2024-08-21 I reviewed my scrimba js study notes in the recap file. I felt confident in my memory, so now I will continue the course this afternoon. I will take a break and crochet or draw for now. 80-22 i crochet a bag for carrying my ipad about in. it's cute. I did pretty well. it would probably get a 70% if graded. Not bad considering it is my 5th thing i have crocheted 

2024-08-24 today is scrimba day. I can feel it! Once Suze is done and I am awake, I'll start.

tomorrow i will rock a full 12 hours. Tonight i am cleaning my office in preparation for a full few days

2024-09-03 new phone day! My last was 2019, and 2017                         fourth too

2-25-09-05 Today i am trying to figure out how to start a .bat file with task scheduler because I do the same task every time i turn on my laptop. Also I streamed for the first time. Dino game and started OBS

2024-09-06 tried to stream from pc but too many issues. Might try David's computer. 07  streeeeeeeeeeam 08 editing and stream. I plan to code too. 08, 09, too

2024-09-13 04:40 iPad dead. Shower and bed

2024-09-16 streamed, but not yesterday because I was social. Today was a good stream :)

2024-09-17 my new streamer from yesterday hung out with me today again. I like chatting with him, Bensen, and my otehr viewers/followers. I like this all so far. People have started to mention my camera being off, but i think i will wait until like 20 followers or 50 followers. 50 is affiliate numbers. Today i am at 7/10 followers, and one follower lost to account deactivation/termination.

2024-09-19 doing my nails then gaming stream. Second typhoon in a week (14 or 15 of season) was redirected up to Shanghai again.

2024-09-21 skipped morning stream. Feeling guilty. I think i may need to push it back on the schedule. (Saturday's )

2024-09-26 met 420StonerBabe on twitch, hopefully we will be able to pair up sometimes. I got 5 new followers today, so 32 to go until affiliation (50) like 700 comments, 8 chatters, and hosted the first thursday followers event.

2024-09-28 streamed and drew. put screens in windows. Waffles!

2025-06-03 I streamed again. At this point I have streamed over 800 hours. I really enjoy streaming. Today was a bad day, but generally i really enjoy streaming. Today was just a bad day. A bunch of people said things that I took as insults. They surely were being rude, but probably as a joke. Lame humour, but humour nonetheless. I really have been negelecting the programmer (and the fitness girl) inside of me, so it is time I get my shit back together and stop neglecting such large parts of myself.

I plan to keep https://teiresa.github.io/ as the highest in the hiarchy, so <i>TechKeen </i> would really just be like a project, but like a project I treat as it's own thing. Currently, the high site is being tricky. I'm working on giving it a complete facelift while I have the time.

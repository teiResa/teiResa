<!-- I have left this file very messy intentionally. I am enjoying bbbbbbbb watching this file grow and reform. It is interesting for me.  Teeeeeeeeest gggggggg yyyyyyy cccccccccc vvvvvvvv  bbbbbb ddddddddd gggggggg pppppppppp ttttttttt eegfgeeeeeeee mmmeeeeeee ewwwww keeeeeeeeeeeey

And I have been making great strides with digital art. I'm starting to not hate everything I make. fgdddddddddd

I am currently working on 30 days of drawing daily. I might keep going with it to 100 days like Ã¯did with the drinking streak. Non-drinking, but I should probab ly calculate whether I have passed 100 days yet.

I started in October, it's now the 19th of December, but I am still drawing daily. I plan to finish this sketchbook by Lunar New Years or Valentines day. Maybe by a month after opening it.

  <summary><b>:notebook: 2022 goal</b></summary>
  I planed to transfer my site <a href="https://techkeen.wixsite.com/website">TechKeen</a> from WIX to My GitHub <a href="https://teiresa.github.io/"> Page </a>. I plan to keep https://teiresa.github.io/ as the highest in the hiarchy, so <i>TechKeen </i> would really just be like a project, but like a project I treat as it's own thing. Currently, the high site is being tricky. I'm working on giving it a complete facelift while I have the time.
  </br></br> In the future, I will hopefully buy a domain. Until then, it gets to live here. 
  
  <br><br> I'm available for an entry-level or junior front-end dev position. Currently, I can only remote work.
